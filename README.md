🚀 NASA Gallery: Your Gateway to the Cosmos
🌌 Overview
Embark on a cosmic journey with our NASA Gallery! This project is a stellar showcase of images fetched from the NASA API, including the awe-inspiring NASA Picture of the Day. Crafted with React and TypeScript, and styled with the sleek Tailwind CSS, our gallery is a testament to the beauty of the universe and the power of modern web technologies.

🌠 Features
Cosmic Collection: Our gallery displays a mesmerizing array of images related to a specific search term. By default, we take you on a tour of various nebulae scattered across the cosmos.
Picture of the Day: Experience the grandeur of the universe with the NASA Picture of the Day, a special feature that brings you a different celestial spectacle every day.
Responsive Navigation: Navigate through our gallery with ease, thanks to our responsive navigation bar, complete with a toggle for mobile view.
🛠️ Components
Hero: This component is the heart of our gallery. It fetches images from the NASA API based on the search term and displays them in a grid layout.
